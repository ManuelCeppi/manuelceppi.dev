I’m also a proud cat parent to Coco, my beautiful black-and-white feline companion. In my free time, you’ll find me playing the piano, diving into a good book or hitting the road on my motorbike. Oh, and I’m a big fan of anime and manga!",
    "experiencesText": "My journey in software development began in 2018 when I joined Wedo s.r.l. as a Junior Developer. During my time there, I gained experience across a variety of projects and technologies, from developing desktop ERP systems in C# to building cloud-based applications using .NET Core and Angular (2). In 2022, I embraced a major shift in my tech stack, transitioning to a PHP environment with Laravel, where I continue to refine my skills and deliver impactful solutions.Below, you’ll find more details about the technologies I’ve worked with throughout my career.",
    "wedoText": "At Wedo, I primarily worked as a consultant, collaborating with various IT businesses on diverse projects. This role exposed me to a wide range of technologies and stacks, including native Android mobile development, web development, and desktop applications. Working on such varied projects not only expanded my technical expertise but also taught me how to adapt and thrive in different team dynamics, collaborating effectively with professionals from diverse backgrounds. For more details about the projects I’ve worked on, feel free to check out my resume.",
    "fortechText": "After transitioning from IT consultancy, I aimed to join a product-based IT company, which led me to Fortech. There, I had the opportunity to work on a significant project for Italy’s largest petroleum company, Eni. The project, named NonOilManager, was a web application designed for cash desk and warehouse management. Built with Angular and .NET Core, it allowed me to contribute as a Full Stack Developer, working seamlessly across both front-end and back-end technologies.",
    "spiaggeText": "In August 2022, I embarked on an exciting new chapter by joining my first startup, Spiagge.it. The experience was both thrilling and transformative as I completely shifted my tech stack. Starting as a Backend Developer using Laravel, I had to quickly learn a new language (PHP) and framework while diving deeper into modern development practices. At Spiagge.it, I also began working with Docker, gaining hands-on experience with infrastructure management and various AWS services like CloudWatch, S3, RDS, and EC2. This role pushed me beyond my limits, fostering significant growth both technically and personally. Additionally, I embraced the Agile (SCRUM) framework, participating actively in ceremonies and collaborating closely with the Product Team and other departments. One of the highlights of this journey was working alongside some of the most talented professionals I’ve ever met. Startup life truly is a unique and rewarding experience, and I’m grateful for the opportunities it has brought me!",
