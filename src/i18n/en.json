Here, i completely changed my tech stack: i've started as a back end developer with laravel, so i had to learn a new language (PHP) and a new framework; I finally started to work with Docker and have a deeper look to infrastructures and all the AWS services that are concerned (CloudWatch, S3, RDS, EC2, ecc); I really had to push my self beyond my limits! I also started to follow more seriously the Agile (SCRUM) framework, with its different ceremonies and interaction with the Product Team and all the other departments. I also have the opportunity to work with some of the most skilled people that i've ever met in my life. Startup experiences really are something else!  ",
